WHAT I have Learned
random.choice = choice(self, seq) method of random.Random instance
    Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.

time.sleep = sleep(...)
    sleep(seconds)

    Delay execution for a given number of seconds. The argument may be
    a floating point number for subsecond precision.
